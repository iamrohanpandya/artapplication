        <p>
          From the last seven years, I have been into paper craft and miniature sculpture. My miniatures feature the culture of the country through art, and festivals of every religion. Apart from this, the statue of many great men is also created.

          Through this art of mine, I have been giving messages on different topics to people living in the country and other countries. Festivals such as Holi, Diwali, Navratri, Ramzan Eid, Christmas, Pongal, Lohri, Kite Festival, Rath Yatra, Janmashtami, Pateti etc. have been depicted through my art. Apart from this, many pieces of art have been created to give messages of caution even in epidemics like Corona.

          I have also given many messages to society through my caricatures named 'Mukeshno Maram'. Paper craft has many of my handmade art pieces, in which portraits of great men have been created, in addition to martyrs of the country. Bird houses are also made in different designs from waste items.

          Save the girl child, educate the girl child, save trees, save water, be addiction free, save the environment, and save healthy life through yoga — I have spread these messages through my art. The use of plastic bags has been stopped and recycled paper bags have also been made and given to people. Children are also taught to make art from old newspapers. Since I have been involved in the business of building model making for years, many students have learned to make models from me.

          I have created many arts on the subject of heritage and art. All handmade — no machines used.
        </p>

          There have been numerous articles about my activities in newspapers, magazines, and TV channels. I have participated in government and private handicraft fairs many times and received honors from NGOs. Through my art and social media like WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram, messages of Indian culture, festivals, and brotherhood continue to circulate in India and other countries.
