        <p>
          Welcome to <strong>Shutrashilps</strong> — a space where passion for detail and handcrafted beauty comes alive.
          My name is [Your Name], and I specialize in creating <strong>miniature art</strong> and intricate <strong>paper crafts</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whether it's a tiny sculpture carved from everyday objects or an elaborate paper installation made with layers and love, 
          each piece is a story of patience, observation, and fine craftsmanship.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started this journey to explore the depth of scale and texture using humble materials, 
          and I’m proud to now share these creations through this digital gallery. 
          Thank you for being a part of this journey!
